## Security Keys - Backup and Restore

### Backup

Backing up your security keys (private and public) are vital to the long term sustainability of your node in the mesh. Once your node is on the mesh with a set of security keys, it is your responsibility to ensure these keys are maintained.

These keys can be saved in a multitude of different ways and should be stored securely.

Available ways to save these keys

1. `meshtastic --export-config > config_backup.yaml` - this is the perferred way to backup configuration, it ensures the keys are saved intact
2. Copy the keys to a secure location, like a password protected note - this is a nice persistent way to save them 
3. Take a screenshot - the most basic way, you must ensure you saved the entire key

### Restore

If you've backed up your keys and performed an action that necessitates a key wipe, a new set of keys will be created. This is most common through the Web Flasher > Full Erase and Install.

After booting your node, you will want to leverage one of these methods to restore your keys.

1. `meshtastic --config config_backup.yaml` - This is the fastest way to get your entire node back to where you left it!
2. Manually retype the keys into the iOS / Android app from your saved locations
